            you’ll ensure security by design and by default. Your products will
            be quality and security optimized, helping you avoid penalties and

            <h3>Manual Testing</h3>
            <p>
              This approach to quality control and quality assurance is based on
              running your software on various devices. Our specialists also pay
              much attention to the convenience and usability of the provided
              product. The main benefits of manual testing:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                A manual quality assurance tester can detect some issues that
                cannot be identified during automated software assessment.
              </li>
              <li>
                This approach provides a better understanding of a product's
                vulnerabilities and issues, which may set a clearer direction
                for its optimization.
              </li>
              <li>
                A manual quality assurance tester provides relevant feedback
                about the usability of a newly developed product and this
                software's user experience.

            <h3>Automated Testing</h3>
            <p>
              Such an approach allows reducing the human impact on the product.
              Automated software testing and quality assurance is more objective
              and attentive to details since it covers all possible issues that
              may disrupt software functionality. It also expands
              functionalities of manual testing, which sets both types of
              product quality assurance as a proper combination. The main
              benefits of automation quality assurance are the following:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Automated quality assurance in software development life cycle
                allows saving time required for the completion of repetitive
                tasks.
              </li>
              <li>
                Such quality assurance services are more objective, which
                eliminates human error.
              </li>
              <li>
                The basic functionalities of automated testing services are
